# Haskell variant of 4096-pt FFT

**This is not an idiomatic Hadkell code, please do not write code like this.**

In order to run the code, you need to install `The Haskell Tool Stack`: please visit the the [How to install](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) section.

Once you've done that, start working on your project with the Stack commands
you know and love.

``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the code.
stack run

# Debug the code.
stack repl
```

Thanks again, and happy haskelling!
