# Haskell variant of 4096-pt FFT

**This is not an idiomatic Hadkell code, please do not write code like this.**

Once you've done that, start working on your project with the Stack commands
you know and love.

``` sh
# Build the project.
stack build

# Run the test suite.
stack test

# Run the benchmarks.
stack bench

# Generate documentation.
stack haddock
```

Thanks again, and happy hacking!
